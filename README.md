# algoritmika.ping-pong

The app is made for 2 people for playing ping-pong. The ball bounces back from the racket. One of them moves by WASD set keyboard, one of them moves by "up, down, right, left" set. Two players are eligible to play game simultaneously. The winner should make the ball hit the opposite player's side (basically the side wall).
